/*
The (UR=A) clause for TNS connect strings was created in response to an enhancement request. This clause can be inserted into the "(CONNECT_DATA=" section of a TNS connect string and allow a privileged or administrative user to connect via the listener even when the service handler is blocking connections for non-privileged users. This feature is introduced since Oracle 10g.

NOTE: The (UR=A) clause is intended to work with a dynamically registered handler so the use of SERVICE_NAME versus SID is preferred. This method can also be used by ASM, Standby Database databases.
